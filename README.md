## Experiments *Compiling Permutations for Superconducting QPUs*

### Installation

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the experiments

```
mkdir output
python run.py
```

### Benchmarks

The benchmarks were created using the file [date_2019.cpp](date_2019.cpp) inside [tweedledum](https://github.com/boschmitt/tweedledum) (in tag *date2019*).
Copy the CPP file into tweedledum's example directory to create an executable from it.

### Reference

These results are described in the paper by Mathias Soeken, Fereshte Mozafari,
Bruno Schmitt, and Giovanni De Micheli: *Compiling Permutations for
Superconducting QPUs*, in: *DATE* 2019.
